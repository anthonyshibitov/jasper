## Javascript PE Reverser

An online Portable Executable viewer.

Current progress:  
[X] Move PE definition to separate file  
[ ] Finish PE definition skeleton  
[ ] Populate data directories  
[X] Interface design  
[ ] Interface redesign. Maybe a tabbed design that other PE explorers use, show hide doesn't work well. Choose new color scheme/layout  
[ ] Refactor `peAnalyze.js` (too much stuff going on in a single file. Move function to a different file)  
[ ] Remove extra CSS files
